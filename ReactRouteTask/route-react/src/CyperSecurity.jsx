    <p className='cs-p'>Cybersecurity works on the same principle as offline security, that is, it aims to protect users and their computer systems. In the real world, you can install video intercoms and locks on all your windows, but on the Internet, it’s not that simple. Internet scammers can gain access to your information in a variety of ways. They can even convince you quite deliberately to send them data simply because you don’t realize you’re being scammed. The Internet is a dangerous space, especially if you are out there alone, so you need confidence in your own safety.</p>
